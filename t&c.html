                of delivery other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by us).
                We may make a deduction from the reimbursement for loss in value of any goods supplied,
                if the loss is the result of unnecessary handling by you.</p>

                    (if earlier) 14 days after the day you provide evidence that you have returned the goods,

                </li>
                <li>

                </li>
            </ol>
            
            </p>
            <p>We will make the reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the
                initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not
                incur any fees as a result of the reimbursement.'</p>
